The Workbench framework continues to flex to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.106` to `0.8.155`


## General

This release is an incremental release as part of the road map for `v.0.9.0`. Please see the full details of the planned changes here: [v0.9.0 Roadmap](../road_maps/0_9_0.md). 


## API Changes
-  Artifact attribute 'uuid' to the more appropriate 'name'
	
	```
	my_model.uuid
	<is now>
	my_model.name
	```

- `capture_uuid` to `capture_name`
	
	```
	end.inference(df, capture_uuid="my_inference_run")
	<is now>
	end.inference(df, capture_name="my_inference_run")
	```
	
- The training holdout method have removed the id_column arg (this information is already known by the FeatureSet)
	
	```
    fs.set_training_holdouts(id_column="my_id", holdout_ids):
    fs.get_training_holdouts(id_column="my_id") 
    <is now>
    fs.set_training_holdouts(holdout_ids):
    fs.get_training_holdouts()
	```
