# Computation View

!!! warning inline end "Experimental"
    The SageWorks View classes are currently in experimental mode so have fun but expect issues and API changes going forward.
    
**Note:** This class can be automatically invoked from DataSource/FeatureSet `set_computation_columns()` [DataSource](../artifacts/athena_source.md) or [FeatureSet](../artifacts/feature_set_core.md). If you need more control then you can use this class directly.
