# Workbench Blogs
!!! tip inline end "Just Getting Started?"
    The Workbench Blogs is a great way to see what's possible with Workbench. Also if you're ready to jump in the [API Classes](../api_classes/overview.md) will give you details on the Workbench ML Pipeline Classes.

## Latest Blogs

- **[Molecular Descriptors NaNs for AqSol Data](residual_analysis.md):** In this Blog we'll look at the popular AqSol compound solubility dataset and walk through the the process of computing Molecular Descriptor (RDKit and Mordred) and taking a deep dive on why NaNs are generated on ~8% of the compounds.

- **[AqSol Residual Analysis](residual_analysis.md):** In this Blog we'll look at the popular AqSol compound solubility dataset and walk backward through the ML pipeline by starting with model residuals and backtracking to the features and input data.

## Corner Cases

These blogs are odd corner cases that we stumbled into and discovered some interesting aspect of Cloud Platforms or ML Pipelines. 

- **[AWS Credentials Refresh Lock](aws_credentials_lock.md)** We discover that the AWS botocore library has a threading lock when refreshing credentials.
