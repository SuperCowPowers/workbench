# OpenADMET Challenge
This challenge is a community-driven initiative to benchmark predictive models for ADMET properties in drug discovery, hosted by OpenADMET in collaboration with ExpansionRx.

## Chemprop
Our submission is a 'meta-model' based on combining results from XGBoost, PyTorch, and Chemprop models. In our testing Chemprop was often the best performing model, so if you're going to use one, use Chemprop.
